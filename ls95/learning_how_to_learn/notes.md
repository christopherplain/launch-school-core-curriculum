## What is Learning?

### Focused vs Diffuse Thinking

#### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes
* Two fundamentally different modes of thinking: **Focused** and **Diffuse** modes
* **Focused**: concentrating intently on something to learn or to understand
* **Diffuse**: relaxed thinking style related to a set of neural resting states
* Both metaphor and analogy are really helpful when trying to learn something new
* Focused mode is like a pinball machine with tight spacing between bumpers
  * Ball moves around in a tight pattern over familiar pathways
  * Mode used when working on something related to familiar concepts
* Diffuse mode is like a pinball machine with widely spaced bumpers
  * Ball travels far and wide before hitting a bumper
  * In this mode things are viewed from a broad, big picture perspective
  * Mode is used when concepts are new or new ideas are needed
* Current neuroscience indicates one is either in the focused mode or diffuse mode
  * Being in one seems to limit access to the other mode

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes
* Dali and Edison used similar techniques to use both modes of thinking
  1. Relax in a chair with a key (Dali) or ball bearings (Edison) in hand above floor
  1. Let mind go free, often vaguely thinking of the problem
  1. Fall asleep, letting the item fall to the floor and waking them up
  1. Return to focused mode with new connections made from diffuse mode
* When learning something new, important to go between the two modes
* Summary
  * Anaologies provide powerful techniques for learning
  * Focused and diffuse modes help us learn but in different ways
  * Learning something difficult takes time, as the brain needs to alternate modes

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

#### A Procrastination Preview
* Everyone struggles to some extent with procrastination
* When we think about something we don't want to do, we activate the pain centers in the brain
  * The brain switches attention to something else to stop negative stimulation
* Process of procrastination
  1. Observe and get a cue about something that causes a bit of unease
  1. To make the sensation go away, turn attention from whatever caused unease toward something more pleasant
  1. Feel happier, temporarily
* Researchers discovered that not long after starting work on what caused discomfort, the neuro-discomfort disappeared
* Pomodoro technique can help with procrastination
  1. Set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions
  1. Focus on task
  1. Reward yourself when done, allowing your brain to change its focus for a while

#### Practice Makes Permanent
* Neurons become linked together through repeated use
* The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality
* Practice makes permanent
  * When you first begin to understand something, the neural pattern from is there but very weak
  * When you solve the problem again fresh from the start, without looking at the solution, you deepen the neuron pattern
  * When you have the problem down cold, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, then the pattern is dark and firm
* When learning, study it hard by focusing intently, then take a break or at least change focus to something different for a while
  * During this time, the brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help with conceptual understanding

#### Introduction to Memory
* **Working memory** (short-term memory) is the part of memory that has to do with what is immediately and consciously processing in your mind
* Working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex
* It's now widely believed the working memory holds only about **four chunks** of 
* Although working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard
  * Often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it stays in working memory
* **Long-term memory**, is like a storage warehouse
* Like a warehouse, it's distributed over a big area
* Research has shown when first putting short-term memory in long-term memory, you need to revisit it at least a few times to increase the chances of accessing it later
* It takes time and practice to move information into long-term memory
* To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition
  * Repeating what you're trying to retain spaced out over a number of days
  * Extending practice over several days makes a difference

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning
* Just being awake creates toxic products in the brain
* During sleep, brain cells shrink, causing an increase in the space between cells, allowing fluid to flow past the cells and wash the toxins out
* Sleep is actually the brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy
* Sleep does more than just allow the brain to wash away toxins; it's an important part of the memory and learning process
* During sleep, the brain:
  * Tidies up ideas and concepts
  * Erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember
  * Rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them
* Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in the ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn
* Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand
  * If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it
  * If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about

## Chunking

### Chunking – The Essentials

#### What is a Chunk?
* Chunking is the mental leap that helps unite bits of information together through meaning
* The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture
* Focusing attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning
* One of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, uniting scattered bits of information through meaning
* The concept of neural chunks also applies to sports, music, dance, really just about anything that humans can get good at
* Focused practice and repetition helps yto create chunks
* Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't need to remember all the little underlying details

#### How to form a Chunk
* The first step in chunking is to **focus undivided attention** on the information you want to chunk
* The second step in chunking is to **understand the basic idea** you're trying to chunk
* The third step to chunking is **gaining context** so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk

#### Illusions of Competence
* One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a book or from notes is simply to reread it
* This approach is \much less productive than another, very simple, technique: **recall**
* After reading the material, simply look away and see what you can recall
* Reasearch showed by simply practicing and recalling the material, students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach
* This improved learning comes whether students take a formal test or just informally test themselves
* The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning and helps us to begin forming chunks
* It's almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks to hang our thinking opon
* The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition
* Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning
* Spending a lot of time with learning material doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it
* Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help strengthen your grasp of the material
