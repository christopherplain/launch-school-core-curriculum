## The Master’s Journey

### What is Mastery?
* It brings rich rewards, yet is not really a goal or a destination but rather a process, a journey
* It’s available to anyone who is willing to get on the path and stay on it
* The master’s journey can begin whenever you decide to learn any new skill

#### The Mastery Curve
* Learning any new skill involves relatively brief spurs of progress, followed by slight decline to a plateau
* To tak the master’s journey, you have to be willing to spend most of your time on a plateau
* Practice diligently and primarily for the sake of the practice itself
* Learn to appreciate and enjoy the plateau as much as the upward surges

### Meet the Dabbler, the Obsessive, and the Hacker

#### The Dabbler
* The Dabbler starts with enourmous enthusiasm 
* The falloff from his first peak comes as a shock
* The plateau is unacceptable and incomprehensible
* He moves on to something else and start the process over again

#### The Obsessive
* The Obsessive is a bottom-line type of person
* He starts off by making robust progress and the first spurt is expected
* When he finds himself on the plateau, he pushes himself, redoubling his efforts
* The Obsessive keeps making brief spurts of progress followed by sharp declines, leading to an inevitable fall
* When when the fall does happen, the Obsessive is likely to get hurt, as are familly, friends, colleagues, etc.

#### The Hacker
* The Hacker, after soft of getting the hang of things, he is willing to stay on the plateau indefinitely
* He doesn’t mind skipping stages essential to development of mastery if he can go out and hang with fellow hackers
* He does only enough to get by

* The catagories are no quite this neat
* It’s possible to be a Master, a Dabbler, an Obsessive, or a Hacker in different areas of one’s life
* These characters help us see why we’re not on the path of mastery

### America’s War Against Mastery
* Advertisement and entertainminet teach that life is an endless series of climaactic moments
* One epiphany follows another, one fantasy is crowded out by the next, climax is piled upon climax
* There is no plateau

#### A War That Can’t Be Won
* “In the long run, the war against mastery, the path of patient, dedicated effort without attachment to immediate results, is a war that can’t be won.”
  * This quote is extremely poignant and prescient given current times

### Loving the Plateau
* Throughout life we are told to do one thing so that we can get something else (e.g., graduate from high school to get into college, get into college to get a job)
* Contingencies are important but life is not so much in the products of our efforts as it is in the process of living itself, how it feels to be alive
* Goals and contingenices are important, but they exist in the future and the past
* Practice, the path of mastery, exists in the present
* To love the plateau is to love what is most essential and enduring in life

## The Five Master Keys

### Key 1: Instruction
* If you intend to tak the journey of mastery, the best thing you can do is arrange for first-rate instruction
* Even those who will some day overthrow conventional ways of thinking need to know what is is they are overthrowing
