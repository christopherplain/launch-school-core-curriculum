## The Master’s Journey

### What is Mastery?
* It brings rich rewards, yet is not really a goal or a destination but rather a process, a journey
* It’s available to anyone who is willing to get on the path and stay on it
* The master’s journey can begin whenever you decide to learn any new skill

#### The Mastery Curve
* Learning any new skill involves relatively brief spurs of progress, followed by slight decline to a plateau
* To tak the master’s journey, you have to be willing to spend most of your time on a plateau
* Practice diligently and primarily for the sake of the practice itself
* Learn to appreciate and enjoy the plateau as much as the upward surges

### Meet the Dabbler, the Obsessive, and the Hacker

#### The Dabbler
* The Dabbler starts with enourmous enthusiasm 
* The falloff from his first peak comes as a shock
* The plateau is unacceptable and incomprehensible
* He moves on to something else and start the process over again

#### The Obsessive
* The Obsessive is a bottom-line type of person
* He starts off by making robust progress and the first spurt is expected
* When he finds himself on the plateau, he pushes himself, redoubling his efforts
* The Obsessive keeps making brief spurts of progress followed by sharp declines, leading to an inevitable fall
* When when the fall does happen, the Obsessive is likely to get hurt, as are familly, friends, colleagues, etc.

#### The Hacker
* The Hacker, after soft of getting the hang of things, he is willing to stay on the plateau indefinitely
* He doesn’t mind skipping stages essential to development of mastery if he can go out and hang with fellow hackers
* He does only enough to get by

#### Summary
* The catagories are no quite this neat
* It’s possible to be a Master, a Dabbler, an Obsessive, or a Hacker in different areas of one’s life
* These characters help us see why we’re not on the path of mastery

### America’s War Against Mastery
* Advertisement and entertainminet teach that life is an endless series of climaactic moments
* One epiphany follows another, one fantasy is crowded out by the next, climax is piled upon climax
* There is no plateau

#### A War That Can’t Be Won
* “In the long run, the war against mastery, the path of patient, dedicated effort without attachment to immediate results, is a war that can’t be won.”
  * This quote is extremely poignant and prescient given current times

### Loving the Plateau
* Throughout life we are told to do one thing so that we can get something else (e.g., graduate from high school to get into college, get into college to get a job)
* Contingencies are important but life is not so much in the products of our efforts as it is in the process of living itself, how it feels to be alive
* Goals and contingenices are important, but they exist in the future and the past
* Practice, the path of mastery, exists in the present
* To love the plateau is to love what is most essential and enduring in life

## The Five Master Keys

### Key 1: Instruction
* If you intend to tak the journey of mastery, the best thing you can do is arrange for first-rate instruction
* Even those who will some day overthrow conventional ways of thinking need to know what is is they are overthrowing

### Key 2: Practice
* Practice as a verb is clear to all of us
* For someone on the master’s journey, the word is best conceived as a noun, something you have
* Practice is the path on which you travel
* A practice can be anything practiced on a regualr basis as an integral part of life
  * A doctor practices medicine and has a practice
* Masters devote themselves to their particular skill not just to get better but because they love to practice
* Because they practice they get better, and the better they get the more they enjoy the practice
* At the heart of it, mastery is practice

### Key 3: Surrender
* The early stages of any significant learning invoke the spirit of the fool
* Surrendering to your teacher and to the fundamentsls of the art are only the beginning
* For the master, surrender means there are no experts, only learners

### Key 4: Intentionality
* Intentionality is using the power that comes from i
* Every master is a master of vision

### Key 5: The Edge
* Masters are dedicated to te fundamentals of their calling
* At the same time, they are the ones likely to press the limits
* The trick is not only to test the edges of the envelope but also to walk the fine line between endless, goalless practice and alluring goals along the way
* Playing the edge is a balancing act

## Tools for Mastery

### Why Resolutions Fail – and What to Do About It
* Backsliding is a universal experince
* Every one of us resists significant change, whether it is for better or worse
* This is homeostasis

  1. Try telling the truth
  1. Honor but don’t indulge your own dark side
     * The author uses anger as an example, but anger is not necessarily, in itself, dark
     * This is one point where I amy disagree with the auther, there is never a time to “honor” that which is truely dark
     * I’ll have to revisit this topic at a later date to see if I see something different in the author’s argument
  1. Set ones priorities
  1. Make commitments, take action
  1. Get on the path of mastery and stay on it

  1. Vanity
  1. Dead seriousness
  1. Inconsistency
  1. Perfectionism

### Mastering the Commonplace
* Most of life is the supposedly “in between”
* Life is filled with opportunites for practicing mastery, which focuses on process rather than product
* Ultimately, nothing in this life is “commonplace” or “in between”
