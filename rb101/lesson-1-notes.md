Notes for Lesson 1 of [Launch School's][launch-school] RB101 course.

## Contents

- [Welcome](#welcome)
- [Using Markdown](#using-markdown)
- [Differences Between Ruby Versions](#differences-between-ruby-versions)

## Welcome

### Discussions vs General Forums

- Separate discussion forums exist for each lesson
- Ask lesson-specific questions in the discussion forum for the lesson
- This is where TAs monitor

### How To Ask For Feedback

- Asking question effectively:
  - Lead with the error message or describe how the error happens
  - Outline the steps taken to address the problem
  - Make a guess as to where the problem lies
  - Paste a link to the code (GitHub)
  - If the error output is long, use Gist and include the link
- [Rubber duck debugging][rubber-duck]

### GitHub Repository

- All code for courses should be pushed to GitHub repos
- Okay to use one repo for course but use a separate folder for each lesson

### Helping Each Other

- Take time to encourage, motivate, help and learn from each other

## Using Markdown

- Forums use GitHub Flavored Markdown for text formatting
- https://github.github.com/gfm/

## Differences Between Ruby Versions

- Features are sometimes added or deprecated in new Ruby releases
- Refer to the Ruby documentation specific to the version of Ruby being run
- In assessments, specific sections of the Ruby docs related to API changes will be required for reference

## Git and GitHub

- Ensure GitHub repos are public
- Commit liberally to local repo and push liberally to GitHub repo
- Push all in-progress work to GitHub before asking for help
- Do not nest Git repos

## Good vs Bad Questions

- A "bad" question asks what is easily observable
- A better question asks why after noting observed behavior
- The trick to remembering all the syntax rules in Ruby is to not remember them
- Develop the habit early on to refresh memory by experimenting with code (e.g., `irb`, `.rb`)
- Don't be offended if someone suggests to try it in `irb`; this is meant to help in the long run

## Lesson Discussion Forums

- Pinned threads are important or helpful discussions
- Take time to read all pinned threads for each lesson
- May request a code review in the discussion forum after completing an assignment
- [Code Review Guidelines][code-review]

## Exercises: Small Problems

- [Small Problem Exercises][small-problem]
- Concurrently work through the "Small Problems" exercises from the Exercises tab
- Complete all easy and medium exercises as preparation for first interview
- Recommend 20 exercises after each lesson to spread work out
- May want to spread exercises out over several days
- Before working on problems read blog article [The Two-Layer Problem][two-layer-problem]
