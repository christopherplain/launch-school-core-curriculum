# Practice Problems: Medium 1

Exercises for Lesson 3 of [Launch Schoolâ€™s](https://launchschool.com) RB101 course.

1. `10.times { |num| puts " " * num + "The Flintstones Rock!" }`
2.  Statement returnes a `TypeError` and can be fixed with either of the following:
    ```ruby
    puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
    puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
    ```
3.  --
    ```ruby
    def factors(number)
      divisor = number
      factors = []
      while divisor > 0 do
          factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
          divisor -= 1
      end
      factors
    end
    ```
4.  The first method modifies the input arguement array and the second will not modify the input argument array.
5.  The method returns an undefined local variable error because `limit` is defined outside the method and out of scope. This can be fixed by adding `limit` as a parameter to the method.
6.  `32`
7.  Yes, the data is modified. `demo_hash` references the same object_id as `munsters` and the expressions modify the referenced hash.
8.  `"paper"`
9.  `"no"`
