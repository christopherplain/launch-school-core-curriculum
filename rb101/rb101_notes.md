# RB101 Notes

Notes for [Launch Schoolâ€™s](https://launchschool.com) RB101 course.

## Lesson 1: Preparations

### Welcome

#### Discussions vs General Forums
* Separate discussion forums exist for each lesson
* Ask lesson-specific questions in the discussion forum for the lesson
* This is where TAs monitor

#### How To Ask For Feedback
* Asking question effectively:
  * Lead with the error message or describe how the error happens
  * Outline the steps taken to address the problem
  * Make a guess as to where the problem lies
  * Paste a link to the code (GitHub)
  * If the error output is long, use Gist and include the link
* [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

#### GitHub Repository
* All code for courses should be pushed to GitHub repos
* Okay to use one repo for course but use a separate folder for each lesson

#### Helping Each Other
* Take time to encourage, motivate, help and learn from each other
